### Exploratory Data Analysis

* Exploratory Data Analysis is a loosely-defined process. Roughly, the stuff between loading data and formal analysis is exploratory.
* Grouping
  * Datasets often consists of groups(by design/implied/nested)
* Quantitative comparisons across groups are informative
  * Measures of Centrality, Variablity, Missingness
* `group_by()` + `summarize()`
  * `group_by` makes grouping explicit and adds a layer to your data
  * `summarize()` allows you to compute one-number summaries
    * most useful in conjunction with `group_by()`


#### `group_by()`
